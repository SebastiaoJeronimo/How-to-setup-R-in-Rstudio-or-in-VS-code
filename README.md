### Install Linux

If you are using **Windows**, you can install Linux through the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/) by searching for a Linux distribution such as **Ubuntu**.

**Note (MacOS users):** You donâ€™t need to install Linux. macOS is Unix-based, so your terminal already supports installing the necessary tools. The recommended way to install R packages and dependencies on macOS is by using Homebrew or the official CRAN installer.  

### Install R in Linux

**Windows**  (via WSL linux)
1. Open the Linux terminal.  
2. Update the system packages and install R:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y  # updates package lists + upgrades existing packages
   sudo apt install -y r-base              # installs R and Rscript
   R --version                             # shows installed R version
   Rscript --version                       # shows installed Rscript version
   ```
3. In VS Code you can open the linux terminal and run the R script with the following command:   
  ```bash
  Rscript nameOfTheFile.r  #replace the name of the file with your R file name please
  ``` 
**MacOS**  
  ```bash
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  brew install r
  ```
